Implement the following changes

- Create a horizontal set of radiobuttons (equivalent in GTK 4) with values "Female" and "Male", alongside the play button

- When playing the sound file either the selected Female or Male voice should be configured

- When playing the sound file, it should reuse the level and timer controls to show the audio activity and time elapsed. Be carefull not to affect the current funcionality when recording an audio file

- in the listbox showing the translated languages, by default the first option (English) should be selected
