# dict-ai-te

**dict-ai-te** is a minimalist desktop application for recording voice notes, transcribing them to text (via the OpenAI API), and saving transcripts to files.

The app is designed for simplicity, with a clean UI inspired by modern voice recorders. Itâ€™s built using Python and GTK 4 via PyGObject for modern Linux desktop integration.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soyrochus/dict-ai-te.git
cd dict-ai-te
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash

```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have a `pyproject.toml` file in the project root (define dependencies as needed).

```bash
uv sync
```

> **Note:**
On Linux, the GTK4 library which the application uses, requires installation of various packages:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  libgtk-4-dev \
  libgirepository-2.0-dev \
  libcairo2-dev \
  pkg-config \
  python3-dev \
  python3-gi \
  python3-gi-cairo \
  gir1.2-gtk-4.0

 ```

And for sound, you need to install:

```sh
 sudo apt install libportaudio2

 ```


### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python -m dictaite
```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root containing your OpenAI API key:

   ```dotenv
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

2. Alternatively, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
